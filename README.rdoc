== README

This small example app is a mixture of rails, angular and D3.  I needed a dataset to use for D3, so last night, (8/13/14), I put up this program on a local server to use the twitter streaming api to monitor the hashtag for Jimmy Fallon's hashtag of the week, it's normally a reliable source for activity.  I left it running over night, and the the graph that is being populated below is the results per hour of tweets that were made with the hashtag #VacationFail.  Below the chart you will find a searchbox, which will allow to search through the collected tweets, a little over 4000.  The results of the search are links to the twitter page of the user who posted the tweet. 

The app may be found live on heroku at:

** As of the moment, angular is giving me issues on heroku, but not on localhost.. not sure why...
